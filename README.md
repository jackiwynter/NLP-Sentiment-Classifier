# NLP-Sentiment-Classifier

### Description:
This project explores sentiment classification using natural language processing techniques to distinguish between positive and negative movie reviews. It involves the creation and evaluation of machine learning models, including a custom wordlist-based classifier and a Naive Bayes classifier. The work also investigates the impact of feature selection on model performance and provides a comparative analysis of classifier effectiveness.

### Key Components:

1. Data Preprocessing: Extraction of unique datasets based on candidate ID and splitting data into training and testing sets.
2. Custom Classifier: Development of a wordlist-based classifier using representative content words from the training data.
3. Evaluation Metrics: Calculation of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to assess model performance.
4. Naive Bayes Classifier: Implementation and comparison with the custom classifier to evaluate strengths and weaknesses.
5. Experimentation: Investigation of the effect of wordlist length on classifier accuracy, supported by graphs and detailed analysis.

### Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- NLTK
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- 
This project demonstrates a hands-on approach to applying NLP techniques to real-world sentiment analysis challenges.
